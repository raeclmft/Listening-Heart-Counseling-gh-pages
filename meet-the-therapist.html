        <p>I am a graduate of John F Kennedy University, obtaining a Master's Degree in Counseling Psychology, with an emphasis in Marriage and Family Therapy. I am certified in Expressive Arts, Group Process, and Grief and Loss Therapy. I have also received additional specialized training in Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</p>

        <p>As a credentialed School Counselor, I have attained certification in the following areas: Behavior Intervention and Management, Strengths and Needs Assessment, and College, Career and Academic Advising. I am also well-versed in Parent coaching, utilizing Positive Discipline, Communication, and Co-Parenting strategies.</p>

        <p>My free time is spent taking photographs, going to the ocean, and hiking with my family. I also enjoy reading and working as a volunteer with horses and other farm animals. Sometimes I can even be talked into sewing or baking, two talents that my family finds quite useful!</p>

        <p>The foundation of my therapeutic philosophy is learning to accept and give love, while enhancing positive connections within primary relationships. My intention is to offer my office as a safe and calming environment free from judgement.  A place for you to discover your true nature and to experience your place in the world.</p>

        <p>To that end, I will listen and support you in reaching your stated goals, creatively and compassionately.  I hope to foster and help strengthen the desire for you to define and embrace your personal power.  I will respect your beliefs and honor your cultural identity.  And most of all, I will celebrate all that makes you UNIQUE!</p>
